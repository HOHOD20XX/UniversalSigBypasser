# Unreal Engine Signature Bypasser

A simple dll designed to hook and bypass the signature check function in Unreal Engine-based games, enabling modding and custom pak/utoc/ucas files in Paks folder. This bypasser is inspired by and based upon the [Lua script](https://gist.github.com/Buckminsterfullerene02/90077ce81c0fd908144498869f4ea288) originally created by LongerWarrior.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the Release section.
2. Extract the zip on the [Releases](https://github.com/rm-NoobInCoding/UniversalSigBypasser/releases) page into your game's Win64 directory (usually found in the `GAMENAME/Binaries/Win64` path).

You're all set! Launch your game normally, and the signature checks will be automatically bypassed.

## Tested Games
I tested bypasser on mutiple games. if you tested this hook on any games and it worked, just create an issue and I will add its name in here!
